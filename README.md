If you would like to run the matlab version you will need additional files but since these files were not created by me I have not uploaded them. Please message me if you would like to run it with matlab. 
Matlab is used to visualize the data easier. You can also use the serial monitor and copy the data over to matlab if you wish to graph it without the matlab importing files. Also message me if you have any questions.
The libraries used are Mstimer2, SPI, and tone2. Mstimer2 and SPI are standard libraries that can be found in the arduino IDE. Tone2 is a custom version of tone. This was done to fix pin overlap in mstimer2. The zip 
file is the library used and I do not own/have created it. Just added for user convenience
